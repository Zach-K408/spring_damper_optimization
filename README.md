Vehicle suspension systems are important to the safe and comfortable operation of a vehicle. A
good suspension system often makes the difference between a good and a bad car. This is why
there is a large amount of existing research towards improving the safety, reliability, and comfort
of these systems.

There are two main types of suspension systems that can be found in most modern-day cars.
Passive and active systems that vary in cost and ability. A passive suspension system is one that
has set parameters like damping coefficient that are designed into it and do not vary. On the other
hand, an active system can be controlled by varying parameters to increase rider comfort. These
systems are usually very complex and costly. A passive suspension system can be optimized during
the design phase of the vehicle to increase the rider comfort while keeping costs and complexity
down.

The two variables that can be optimized are the spring stiffness and damping coefficient of the
suspension system. The variation of these values has a large impact on the vertical motion of
the vehicle body as it travels over a road surface. A "loose" suspension can result in exaggerated
wave-like motion of the vehicle as it travels over bumps which is uncomfortable for passengers. A
very "stiff" suspension can result in the force from every bump being directly transferred to the
passengers which is jarring and uncomfortable as well. The optimal system is one that balances
these two scenarios and is different based on the vehicle type. Race cars need stiff suspension
for the best handling performance while regular passenger vehicles require the most comfortable
option while maintaining safety.

The objective of this repository is to optimize the spring stiffness and damping coefficients of a passive suspension system, which is modelled using the following quarter-car model and a random road input profile _u_.
